This application is a parody of the well-known entertainment site. You can add and remove videos from YouTube, SoundCloud, Facebook, Vimeo, Twitch, Streamable, Wistia, DailyMotion, Mixcloud, Vidyard, Kaltura. The application is still in development, but adding videos, deleting them, likes and views are already working. As a video player I use React-Player. Currently working on adaptive scss for mobiles and tablets, better pagination, new pages, users profiles and etc.
